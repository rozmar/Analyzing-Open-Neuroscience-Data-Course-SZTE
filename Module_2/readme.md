# Brain Computer Interface dataset

This module shows you how to open and analyze the Brain Computer Interface Behavior. These are unpublished experiments of a new behavior, using cutting-edge technology. We can already access this dataset due to the Allen Institute's commitment to open science and transparency.

This lesson was taken from the Summer Workshop for the Dynamic Brain 2025 (https://alleninstitute.org/events/summer-workshop-on-the-dynamic-brain-2025/)

Experiments: Kayvon Daie, Marton Rozsa, Christina Wang
