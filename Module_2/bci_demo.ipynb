        "In this tutorial, we'll use neural activity data collected from mouse primary motor cortex before, during, and after animals learn a brain-computer interface task to address the following question: How do neuron interactions change after learning?\n",
        "    \n",
        "The data we're working with is part of the ongoing [Credit Assignment During Learning project](https://www.allenneuraldynamics.org/projects/credit-assignment-during-learning) at the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics. In this experiment, mice learn to control the activity of a specific neuron in order to receive rewards using a brain computer interface (BCI) paradigm. The activity of the conditioned neuron is read out in real time and is linked to the movement of a reward spout. Over a few trials, the activity of the conditioned neuron becomes coupled to the movement of the spout and the mouse learns to activate that neuron to move the spout towards its mouth to receive a reward. In contrast to other behavior tasks, this task enables us to study how learning of a single neuron can affect other cells in the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Background:**\n",
        "    \n",
        "This experiment was designed to test competing models of learning rules—such as Hebbian learning, long-range input modulation, and biologically plausible approximations of error backpropagation—by directly measuring changes in neural activity and inferred connectivity during learning. The core task involved a closed-loop BCI paradigm in which a single neuron’s activity controlled a reward mechanism. Because the mapping from activity to behavior was fully defined by the experimenter, this paradigm enables ground-truth labeling of neurons as behaviorally causal (e.g., the conditioned neuron) versus merely correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "To probe learning-related circuit changes, cellular-resolution two-photon photostimulation was used to perturb neurons before and after learning. By analyzing evoked responses, researchers could infer the presence and strength of functional connections. Learning-induced changes in connectivity were then compared to predictions from recurrent neural network models trained with different plasticity rules, enabling discrimination between competing learning algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Experiment:**\n",
        "Neural activity was recorded from layer 2/3 excitatory neurons in the primary motor cortex of head-fixed mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Imaging was performed over multiple days as each animal learned and performed a BCI task. Each day, a new conditioned neuron (CN) was selected and the activity of this neuron was mapped in real-time to the position of a motorized reward port. To receive water rewards, mice had to learn to increase the activity of the conditioned neuron to move the port into reach.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the BCI task, the dataset includes blocks where spontaneous activity was recorded and photostimulation blocks in which individual or groups of neurons were optogenetically stimulated to assess their causal influence on the surrounding network. These connection mapping sessions were repeated daily to measure how connectivity changed as learning progressed. Imaging data were preprocessed using Suite2p or CellPose and include motion-corrected fluorescence traces, extracted ROIs, and stimulus-aligned behavioral data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Approach:**  \n",
        "What analysis method can we use to address this question?\n",
        "    \n",
        "One simple way to assess neuron interactions is by quantifying how correlated their activity patterns are. If neurons are consistently co-active, they are causally connected - likely connected directly, connected indirectly, or receive shared input as part of an interacting circuit.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Goals:**\n",
        "This tutorial walks through how to:\n",
        "* access the metadata and data\n",
        "* plot neural activity aligned with experimental epochs and behavioral events\n",
        "* use Pearson Correlation to assess changes in neural activity before and after learning\n",
